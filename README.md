## Applied Cryptography Application

This application provides a user-friendly interface to implement various cryptographic techniques, ensuring secure communication, data integrity, and information exchange. It offers a comprehensive set of functionalities, including encryption, decryption, and hashing, catering to both text and file inputs.

### Symmetric Encryption and Decryption
1. *XOR Encryption and Decryption:* XOR cipher is a simple and efficient symmetric encryption technique.
2. *Caesar Cipher Encryption and Decryption:* Caesar cipher is a classic substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down the alphabet.
3. *Block Cipher Encryption and Decryption:* Block ciphers encrypt plaintext in fixed-size blocks, providing strong security.

### Asymmetric Encryption and Decryption
1. *RSA Encryption and Decryption:* RSA algorithm is widely used for secure communication over the internet. It involves public and private keys for encryption and decryption.
2. *Diffie-Hellman Encryption and Decryption:* Diffie-Hellman key exchange protocol allows two parties to establish a shared secret over an insecure channel.

### Hashing Functions
1. *MD5 Hash Generator:* MD5 (Message Digest Algorithm 5) produces a 128-bit hash value, commonly used for checksums and integrity verification.
2. *SHA-1 Hash Generator:* SHA-1 (Secure Hash Algorithm 1) produces a 160-bit hash value, commonly used in digital signatures.
3. *SHA-256 Hash Generator:* SHA-256 produces a 256-bit hash value, offering stronger security and collision resistance.
4. *SHA-512 Hash Generator:* SHA-512 produces a 512-bit hash value, providing enhanced security and protection against brute-force attacks.

### Usage
- Text inputs can be directly entered into the application interface.
- File inputs allow users to upload files for encryption, decryption, and hashing.
- Users can select the desired encryption algorithm, decryption algorithm, or hashing function from the provided options.
- The application provides clear instructions and feedback to guide users through the encryption, decryption, and hashing processes.
